# etch-a-sketch

Etch-A-Sketch Project for The Odin Project

Retrospective:

Basic implementation of the project is complete. Want to come back later and clean up style, add an eraser tool, add color selector, and maybe even a way to save certain drawings to local storage?

Project went much smoother than expected. Required lots of googling but I felt like I was able to track down answers quickly and make sense of them

Would really like to buff my CSS skills just to make it less of a hurdle when it comes to projects (ie: how do i get a grid of equally sized squares) but i feel like i made big strides in understand how to get CSS to do the bare minimum for me

Outside of CSS struggles, most difficult part was getting up event listeners on each of the squares that was generated after the DOM content loaded. Tried to use event delgation but couldnt get it working. The method I ended up going with isn't too messy though
